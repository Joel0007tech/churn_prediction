## CHURN PREDICTION
### This model aims at predicting when customers stop doing business with a company.For example, a customer canceling a subscription or switching to a competitor. Businesses care about predicting churn so they can take action to retain customers.
### PROJECT WORKFLOW
-- Dataset to be explored was provided
-- Necessary libraries were imported such as `numpy` `pandas` `sklearn` `matpltlib`
-- The dataaset was loaded into the enironment created already uisng the `pd.read_csv()`
-- Data Preprocessing was done, next ensuring the data is clean and checking for null values
-- The data train and test splitting was done, splittiing the data into 80% train data, and 20% test data for the training.
-- Linear regression and Rnadome Forest was used for the model building
-- The models were compared to predict if a customer will churn
-- Data Visualitzation was done showing the line of best fit
